YAY fun

Hello there!

My name is Stephanie Ruiz and I am an ucoming Junior! I like to play basketball and talk to people.
I speak Spanish, snapchat a lot, and like popcorn.
I think I am a Cognitive Science major but I might be doing Public Health instead, or who knows, maybe both?
I want to do an Education or Computer Science minor and this class is the deciding factor of which one I do.
